      "Trust not in kings, for flesh they are such only,\nThey shall return to dust as all men.\nWisdom of man and plans of all men mighty,\nAll such shall perish soon in the grave. \nPut not ever your trust in any man,\nTrust in the Lord, who is Almighty God,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "Happy the man, whose help is God of Jacob,\nWho hopes in God who is Lord of all.\nFaithful is He, the Lord of grace and justice,\nBlessed is he who trusts in this God.\nIn Him you have all wisdom and all strength,\nIn Him alone you have all that you need,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "Creator of the earth and of all heaven,\nWho made the seas and who made all things.\nHis word shall stand forever and forever,\nHis promises shall stand so secure.\nThis God Almighty the all sovereign Lord,\nThe Faithful Jehovah, the Holy God,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "Injustice, Lord you hate and you stand for right,\nOppressed ones you defend and protect.\nIn times of famine, God shall still provide food,\nAll that you need, the Lord shall provide.\nIn God, the prisoner shall be free indeed,\nBowels of mercy we have in Jesus,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "Eyes of the blind the Lord God shall soon open,\nHumble and meek, the Lord shall raise up.\nAll those that trust the Lord and have faith in Him,\nThe Lord shall always show them His love. \nAll strangers, widows and orphans, listen,\nAlmighty God shall provide all your needs; \nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "All who forget the Lord and forsake Jesus,\nThe Lord shall leave them to their own ways.\nThat they may suffer for their sin and actions,\nThe folly of their life all shall see.\nThe Lord God is the King for evermore,\nZion the Lord shall bless now and always,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n",
      "Come all you Saints and praise the Lord Jehovah,\nWondrous His works we shall always see.\nAll those that have the Spirit shall say, “Amen”!\nCome let us sing praise and thank the Lord.\nAll children of the Lord come now and sing,\nPraise God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\nHallelujah, Hallelujah.\n"
