      "From my transgressions, I shall turn,And come to Thee, O Lord my God.Lord show me Thy ways, inward truth,Lord, teach me wisdom in my heart.Put Lord Thy Spirit in my heart,And cleanse me from all evil ways;Forgive me Lord for all my sin.",
      "In vain I try to flee from Thee,There is no hiding place for me.I am not hid from Thee, O Lord,Thou art the Lord Omnipresent.No one can run away from Thee,You are all seeing God of love,I groan in sin, O help me Lord.",
      "Refuge I seek in Jesus Christ,Grace in Thy sufferings Lord I seek.Restore my life and give me joy,Even in death bless me, O Lord.Thou Lamb of God, the Savior art,Forgiveness we all have in Thee,Our sin You bore on Calvary’s Cross.",
      "Lord I resolve to live for Thee,Despise the world and vanities.Hate, shame, rejection suffer now,Nothing can turn me back from You.Lord grant me strength that I might bear,And fight the good fight all my life,Be faithful unto death for Thee."
